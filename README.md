# Mini-3d-printer
Project Overview

This project is a Mini 3D Printer, designed and developed as the final year project for a Diploma in Mechatronics Engineering. The project showcases a compact and efficient 3D printing solution, built using Tinkercad and Blender for design and modeling.

Features

Compact and lightweight design

High-precision printing

User-friendly operation

Efficient filament usage

Suitable for prototyping and educational purposes

Software Used

Tinkercad – For 3D modeling and electronic design

Blender – For detailed 3D modeling and rendering

Project Components

3D-printed structural parts

Stepper motors for movement

Microcontroller for control

Heated bed (optional)

Nozzle and extruder assembly

Power supply and wiring

How It Works

Design the 3D model using Tinkercad or Blender.

Slice the model using slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).

Upload the G-code to the printer’s microcontroller.

Start printing and monitor the process.

Setup Instructions

Assemble the printer components following the design.

Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.

Calibrate the printer (bed leveling, nozzle height, etc.).

Load filament and start printing.

Future Enhancements

Implementing wireless connectivity

Adding auto-bed leveling

Improving speed and precision
